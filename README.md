## Lessons Learned

I learned both building and designing a website is not simple! For the first phase, setting up multiple API requests was the biggest hurdle, especially since each API is organized differently, making it difficult to cross reference a show across different APIs. Unfortunately that was not completed, but I was able to set up filtering and search capabilities with the help of my educators, classmates, and online resources. I'm excited to continue building the site until it can be deployed to the public!
